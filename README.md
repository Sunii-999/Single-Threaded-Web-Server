# Building a Web Server

This repository taught me how to use TCP and HTTP. Listen to TCP connection on a socket. Parsing a small number of HTTP requests, and after create a proper HTTP response. Finally improve the throughput of the server with a ThreadPool.

This was built with the use of [The-Rust-Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch21-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).

As the documentation also mentions there are multiple ways to create a web server with the use of Crates created by other community members. But the structure and process of the documentation is to _teach_ so newcomers such as myself can _learn_.

This is a basic HTTP server and thread pool so we can understand the general ideas / techniques of the crates that revolve around this.
